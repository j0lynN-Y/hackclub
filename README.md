1. Cascade YSWS - MusicPulse (A CSS Animation) - I am a percussionist for my school band and I thought it would be cool to make an animation for crotchets, quavers, triplets, semiquavers, quintuplets and sextuplets! If this sounds a bit foreign, this animation simply serves to help visualise how 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 notes fit into 1 beat. This webpage also has some fun information about the different note durations, as well as examples of music pieces that use these note durations very prominently!
