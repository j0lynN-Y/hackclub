1. Cascade YSWS - MusicPulse (A CSS Animation) - I am a percussionist for my school band and I thought it would be cool to make an animation for crotchets, quavers, triplets, semiquavers and quintuplets! If this sounds a bit foreign, this animation simply serves to help visualise how 2, 3, 4 and 5 notes fit into 1 beat.
